</h1> -->

I have a degree in systems analysis and development, I am looking for opportunities to collaborate voluntarily in a project with different purposes. My passion is for ReactJS.
- 🔭 I am currently working with .net core and sql server.
- 🌱I'm always looking for new knowledge, mainly in front-end development with ReactJs and layout designer.
- 🤝I'm looking to collaborate on automation projects involving ReactJs. But I'm interested in projects with the most varied purposes.
